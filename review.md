title: Review Proposals
---

All talk proposals will undergo open community review before decisions are made on what material to include in our program. The final selection of presentations is determined by the OS-SIG through a combination of community interest, relatedness to our [formats](formats.md), and diversity of representation.

You are welcome to review all talk submissions on our <a href="https://github.com/ohbm/osr2021/issues">GitHub repository</a>. We also invite you to comment on items tagged as "emergent", and get in contact with the organisers if you are interested in joining the discussion.

You are reminded that you will be expected to communicate on these proposals in accordance with the
<a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3912">Code of Conduct</a>.

In order to comment on or endorse a proposal, you will be required to log into GitHub.
If you do not have a GitHub username, we invite you to follow the instructions available
<a href="https://github.com/join">here</a> to create your free account.
